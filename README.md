# datasci266-NER-project
This research aims to develop a context-enriched NER pipeline to detect and categorize mentions of people, places, brands, and products in video comments. Unlike conventional NER, our approach will incorporate comment-reply hierarchies and semantic embeddings to refine entity recognition and identify emerging trends.
