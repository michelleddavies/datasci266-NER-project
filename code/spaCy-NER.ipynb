Price for this kind of space may be higher than for tunnel itself. I see wealthy investors that are in hurry and need this kind of \"connection\" , maybe somwhere in the underground garage? Then they want some bucks for every customer that will use it (and becouse of it, it will be quite expensive). And what about the other side, there will be heavy traffic around this hole (in a suburb area ?) Does every hole connects to every other ? It seems that elevator part can be costly (for safety alone). What about collision-free conjunctions? It has to be made by damn-good AI, real web of tunnels, and managed by it too. And no combustion-engine cars allowed, and no hazardous cargo. And what abaut malfunctions of a cart (Murphy's law says there will be truble). Very bold and necessary (for Mars missions and for Hyperloop), but very gimmicky. It seems to me that in era of ubiquitous drones, \"flying cars\" have greater chance for succes (despite that every one of them has to land, but some of them will land in emergency mode :) This project in my eyes is far harder than sending a rocket to Mars, because rocket have to fight with gravity, and tunnels have to fight with reluctance.\n",

Hint: it never does, and sometime, fear, lack of openness in the design process, etc. make it so that, even if it was vaguely \"possible\" to get a result, it will either be supplanted by something else, with its own limitations and problems, or it will never, ever, result in the exact form you imagined. What ever bits of the silly nonsense Musk keeps rambling about that do happen, they will look **nothing at all** like what he, or any of the other squirrely, semi-paranoid, \"visionaries\" imagine it will, unless, ironically, someone 50-100 years after the \"real one\" comes along decides to create a \"retro\" version. A sort of \"Fallout game\" equivalent of, \"What if we actually had all those crazy breakthroughs back in 2020, when the world looked so backwards and had so many silly idea?\"Much of the stuff he comes up with, like every generation of \"visionaries\", is silly and absurd, even to the people living in it. Because, again... WTF good is it to take the existing problem, i.e., lack of public transportation, and/or sensible solutions to move people around, and shove all that into single vehicle, underground, and overly bloody complicated, \"single car transporters, which, when things f up, will leave you stuck down there, or misqueue and shove your car up under someone else on the road up top (or possibly open the hole in front of the car already there, or.. Good design means, \"Fewer things that can go wrong.\", not, \"Heh, I think Rube Goldberg had a great solution to our traffic problem, here is how I would implement it!!\" Yikes! And the cost of doing it the stupid way, instead of just... firing all the idiots that keep stealing money from things like California\\'s transit system (which would, sadly, be most of the politicians in the state), and actually building a light rail system for people... Mind, just to be clear on this - this is proof that Democrats, while they may be pro-social issues, are still conservative/greed driven on every other subject, and thus **not actually progressives**. The idiots in charge in other cities, including mine, which is conservative run, and in Arizona, pull the same thing, on the same issues. They recently killed public transportation (because, well, when no one, because of how the city is laid out, in part, can \"get\" to the damn bus, its kind of silly to whine about there being no one riding them), but, while they where still trying to fund it, they had a small.. hickup. Seems, millions went \"missing\", which where supposed to be allocated to the project. They, surprisingly, \"found\" enough millions, misallocated to other projects, to fix this, but \"never\" managed to work out how, whoops!, it went missing in the first place. I mean, seriously? When they can\\'t f-ing keep track of where money went/got spent in **either** Republican or Democrat run cities/states, is it any wonder why both sides have some completely delusional ideas about how the economy works, with the former thinking that it all \"fixes itself, via market forces\", while the latter seems to think it just grows on trees?\\nSorry about that bit of rant, but.. seriously, you can\\'t, \"Do what is needed to elevate people above the problems they can\\'t solve themselves.\", by \"hoping\" the money will magically appear when needed, instead of.. actually planning out how to spend it sensibly (the Democrat\\'s problem), nor by just going, \"Well, gosh... we have no idea where it went, but those people are not trying hard enough to fix their own problems anyway, so why worry? The market will fix everything, and I have this spendy project that will help the market coming up, so I need to cut something from children\\'s food programs to pay for it!\" (the Republican solution). Where the F are the people, who we can vote for, that believe in a) actual accounting for the money, and b) actually making sure the freaking solutions \"fix\" the actual problems, instead of just wishing they fix themselves, or praying the money will drop out of the sky, to fund something they don\\'t actually pay enough attention to for them to know if its working, or not, or why not? And... then we get the people like Musk coming along with, \"I got a damn silly idea, but since I am a \"visionary\", you can really believe in it! Lets build it!\" Arghhh!!!!!!!',\n",

    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The evaluation metrics for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) model are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions (true positives + false positives). A higher precision indicates fewer false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**: Recall measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances. It is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives (true positives + false negatives). A higher recall indicates fewer false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-score**: The F-score (or F1-score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall. A higher F-score indicates a better balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "The bar chart visualizes the evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, and F-score) for the NER model. Each bar represents the score for a specific metric, providing a clear comparison of the model's performance across these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "The optimization history plot shows the changes in the objective value (F-score) over the course of the optimization trials. This helps in understanding how the model's performance improved with different hyperparameter configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter importance plot highlights the significance of each hyperparameter in achieving the best model performance. This helps in identifying which hyperparameters have the most impact on the model's F-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Predictions\n",
    "The sample predictions section provides a qualitative assessment of the model's performance by comparing the predicted entities with the ground truth entities for a few examples from the evaluation set. This helps in understanding the types of entities the model is able to recognize correctly and where it might be making errors."
